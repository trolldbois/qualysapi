What is this folder ?
=====================

this folders can contains:
1. [DEV requirement] XSD files from Qualys. These file are not redistributed. You can pull them using build-scripts.
these files contains Object descriptions from Qualys.

webapp.xsd: WAS Web Application Records objects
webappauthrecord.xsd: WAS web application Authentication Records objects
scan.xsd: VM Scan objects
schedule.xsd: VM Schedule objects
report.xsd: VM report objects
optionprofile.xsd: VM option profile objects
finding.xsd: VM finding objects


2. python files generated by generateDS
Each XSD file produces two Python module:
a - webapp.py: immutable (don't change it) class definitions
b - webappsubs.py: developper modifiable module (pretty __str__ for example)

The ...subs.py modules can be used by using the parsing function of that module.

the qualysapi.core class basically takes care of that for each QualysModule

How were these files generated ?
================================
For each .xsd file, the following command was run:
a. generateDS -o "webapp.py" -s "webappsubs.py" webapp.xsd

creating both module, from the XSD definition.
